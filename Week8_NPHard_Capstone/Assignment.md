# Week 8 - Signature Assignment: Enhance a Distributed Systems Architecture for an Enterprise to Solve Potential Problems

## Instructions

Use the scenario for the retailer enterprise (XYZ Distributing) with different plants and stores distributed across many states and launching a globalization strategy from the Week 1 assignment of this course. The strategic plan for XYZ Distributing also includes increasing online presence and expanding their distribution channels. The retailer chain manufactures and distributes three clothing lines that are also marketed in other major retailer chains and online. The company has its headquarters in South Carolina; a major manufacturing plant in Seattle, Washington; and another in Maine; plus 30 stores nationwide. And they’ll soon be opening three international stores—one each in Spain, England, and New Zealand. They have approximately 3,000 employees. Their computing infrastructure is of approximately 500 computers, 200 point-of-sale terminals connected to servers distributed at headquarters in South Carolina, Seattle, and Maine. There are an estimated 300 printers also distributed and shared across the network.

The main applications being executed in this network are

- Domain Name Server (DNS)
- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution
- Corporate Project Management System (in-house developed application communicating with the ERP)
- Distributed File and Database Servers (Oracle, Informix, DB2, Sybase, and SQL Server)

For your Signature Assignment, identify an operational or technical issue that could be resolved or refined by enhancing or improving the distributed systems model. Develop a proposal including or elaborating on the following items:

- Describe the problem, and then explain why you think taking a distributed approach to solving it will reduce the time to solve the problem and improve performance while ensuring security.
- Identify the resources in the system. They are virtually unlimited, but you must identify how the problem will be distributed, both in the diagrams and narrative.
- Identify and discuss how communication channels and styles with nodes in the system will occur and how access to the data will be managed.
- Identify how the problem will be distributed in the system, and how will each node get its work. Consider recommending an existing algorithm, like the Paxos algorithm, to use.
- Propose fault tolerance models to ensure availability, consistency, and integrity or operations and processes, plus recovery modes and considerations.

As an alternative to the above-listed items, solve the problem in the programming language of your choice for the scripts or logical models, and submit screenshots of the working solution, code, and chart mapping time of completion to a number of participants.

Search the NCU Library to find 10 of the most recent scholarly papers that theorize solutions to NP-Hard problems. Provide a reference and a summary of each source, and then explain what the problem is and how solving it benefits distributed systems or computer science in general. In other words, formulate a concise literature review on the state of solving NP-Hard problems. Include this reflection as part of your paper.
