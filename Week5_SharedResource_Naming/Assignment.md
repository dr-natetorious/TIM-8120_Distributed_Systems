# Assignment

For this assignment, you will explore the network diagram created in the previous assignment and design a naming scheme for all nodes represented in the network diagram. You will write a narrative explaining the naming structure and meaning of each allocated node name associated with its function within the network. Once the naming scheme has been developed, map each node in the diagram with its node name and the operating system running in each. This is the concept or one of the differences between a conceptual and physical network diagram.

Using the same network diagram, you will explore and implement a memory management model. First, you will compare memory management approaches like single contiguous allocation, partitioned allocation, and segmented allocation.

Study memory models like POSIX for Unix systems, and the Windows functions for network memory mapping like CreateSharedMemory, CreateFileMapping, and MapViewofFile to map a file across multiple processors. Describe how each one of these models handles main, cache, and secondary memory; access levels; and processing activities related to each application. Create another diagram depicting the applications running in each node, now listing memory management techniques for scalable processing.

You will submit a paper of 5- to 7-pages (not including cover page and references) presenting the results of your analysis and recommendations, with screenshots of the diagrams designed along with its explanations and interpretations. You will also submit the network mapping diagrams (2) created as part of the analysis.

Your paper should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course by providing new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect scholarly writing and current APA standards.
