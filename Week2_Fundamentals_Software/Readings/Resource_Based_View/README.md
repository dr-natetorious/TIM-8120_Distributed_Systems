# Resource Based View

## The impact of supply chain analytics on operational performance: a resource-based view (2014)

The authors [Chae, B; Olson, D; Sheu, C](SupplyChainAnalytics.pdf) seeks to understand the role of _Supply Chain Analytics_, as it related to a _resource-based view_. Their goal is to determine strategies for improving operational performance and customer satisfaction.

> We define the architecture of SCA as the integration of three sets of resources, `data management resources (DMR), IT-enabled planning resources (IPR) and performance management resources (PMR)`, from the perspective of a resource-based view.

Supply chain management is a growing area of interest as these business analytics enable the enterprise to be more competitive. Customer's want their goods delivered in near real-time. However, there are challenges with efficiently pre-caching these goods in facilities near the customer without potentially retaining additional inventory. These additional inventory represents risk to the business as (1) it might be purchased and (2) represents cash that could have been spent for other goods.

> SCA research is in its early stage and there is a general lack of theory and of empirical studies. Using the resourcebased view (RBV) as the theoretical base, this study expands the understanding of components and performance of SCA. The principal idea of the RBV is that the competitive advantage of a firm lies in its heterogeneous resources, which are valuable, inimitable and non-substitutable (Barney 1991).

### What is the Resource Based View of SCA

> The RBV holds that resources vary across firms, and differences in resource levels that persist over time enable firms to sustain competitive advantage (Penrose 1959; Wernerfelt 1984; Barney 1991). Under RBV, various technological and organisational practices can be considered resources for acquiring sustained competitive advantage. For instance, organisational knowledge, managerial skills, backend integration, technology and manufacturing facilities are viewed as manufacturer resources (Dong, Xu, and Zhu 2009).

> The emergence of new terms, such as SCA, reflects a broad interest in leveraging the business value of supply chain data and harnessing the power of various analytical technologies and methods. Top performing companies are better at utilising their data for business planning and execution (Kiron et al. 2011; Lavalle et al. 2011) and this has led to the increase in supply chain integration and visibility (Viswanathan and Sadlovska 2010; O’dwyer and Renner 2011).

> [F]irm resources (e.g. IT) as a source of sustained competitive advantage are used to conceptualise SCA, to test the relationships between different SCA-related resources and to predict their impact on supply chain planning satisfaction and operational performance.

Essentially, everything within an organization is a resource and IT-enabled resources are a subclass. As these IT-enabled resources are paired with data they become more intelligent and can allow the business to make smarter decisions. It is therefore advantageous to identify and expand on the benefits of DMR + IRP and PMP.

> For example, IT-based planning reveals forecasting errors, overstocks and other issues, which require coordination to fix. As a result, IPR is expected to increase the need for performance management. Firms are likely to increase relevant resources for performance management. [...] The RBV of SCA
indicates that DMR and IPR are more technological than organisational, while the opposite is true for PMR.

This diagram shows the correlation coefficient between the different concepts, based on the feedback of 571 manufacturing experts responses.

> These findings shed light on the importance of firms’ DMR for SCM activities and performance. Few studies have empirically examined the impact of DMR on Supply Chain Management (SCM). [...] There is empirical support that SCA positively impacts outcome variables: supply chain planning satisfaction (SAT)
and SCM performance (SCP). We find that all three sets of IT-enabled resources (DMR, IPR and PMR) have a positive impact on supply chain planning satisfaction (SAT). On the other hand, the correlation of DMR and IPR with SCP is found to be statistically insignificant (Table 4). This
implies that IT-enabled resources for data management and supply chain planning are important, but do not seem to create business value themselves. Instead, DMR and IPR, which are more technological resources for SCA, have an indirect impact on SCM performance through complementary resources, PMR.

## INFORMAL PLANNING IN DEPOPULATING RURAL AREAS: A resource-based view on informal planning practices (2017)

The authors [Syssner, J; Meijer, M](InformationPlanning_in_Depopulating_Rural_Areas.pdf) explore strategies for resource planning in areas that are reducing the population. This perspective is different from most research that focuses on ubranization or expanding the organizations footprint into growing markets.

> A growing number of scholars have responded to the plea for alternative planning perspectives. However, most of these studies have been carried out in urban environments such as Detroit, Philadelphia and Leipzig. In such contexts, depopulation materialises in the hollowing out of urban cores and/or in urban sprawl, and the planning strategies advocated in these settings often involve attempts to use vast spaces in innovative ways, such as for ‘greening the city’. The spatial manifestations of shrinkage, however, differ in urban and rural contexts, as do the policy and planning implications of shrinkage.
> [...]
> Our framework is based on two rudimentary yet interrelated observations. First, it builds on the notion that in order to understand planning in sparsely populated areas, it is necessary to acknowledge both formal and informal planning practices. Here, our analytical focus is on informal planning
practices. Second, our framework builds on the observation that since the resource base is altered in depopulating areas, it is necessary to take a broader perspective in order to understand the available resources. That is, we adopt a resource-based view of the planning process, and focus on resources that are planned and resources that are generated through planning. In conclusion, we suggest that informal planning practices can generate a wide range of resources
that can be used for the potential benefit of the local community.

### Relational, Contextual and Situtational Resources

> Here, we argue that all resources must be seen as being relational, contextual and situational. In a relational understanding, a resource is believed to come about in relation to a need or an intended outcome and in relation to the actors who generate it. Bathelt and Glückler (2005, 1547) make a strong argument for a relational rather than substantive understanding of resources, while opposing the habitual idea that resources should be ‘limited in terms of their availability’, and ‘used up through consumption’ (ibid.). With a relational understanding of resources, they argue, resources are not necessarily limited, and their use-value or application is not necessarily predetermined (ibid.).
> That resources are contextual is critical. This implies that what is conceptualised as a resource in one social, spatial or political context may not be conceptualised as a resource in another setting.
> That resources are situational is understood here to add a temporal understanding of resources. A resource is a resource not only under certain contextual conditions, but also during specific periods of time.

A core idea of the paper is that resources are relational, contextual and situational; such that they are only resources if they are useful when they are needed. For instance, if Bob needs a shovel -- _one that is 1,000 miles away is still a shovel but not a resource_. There needs to be considerations around the avaiability of the assets, so their potential fully maximized. As areas become more sparse, the cost of these resources increases which results in a need for more efficient placement NOT a complete abandonment.
