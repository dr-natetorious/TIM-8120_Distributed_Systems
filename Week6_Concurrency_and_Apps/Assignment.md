# Section 3: Week 6: Research Clock Synchronization Models for Processor Concurrency

For this week’s assignment, you will research clock synchronization models and prepare a document discussing protocol and algorithms to manage file and task allocation, distribution, and execution across multiple processors in a system. As you insert the clock model in your network diagram from previous assignments, describe their function, structure, and benefits.

- Physical Clocks—timers, counters, registers, Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)
- Clock Synchronization Algorithms—internal and external synchronization, clock drift, and drift rate
- Network Time Protocol
- Berkeley Algorithm
- Clock Synchronization in Wireless Networks—Reference Broadcast Synchronization (RBS)
- Logical Locks—Lamport’s logical locks, event counters
- Total Ordered Multicasting
- Vector Clocks
- Token-Based Solutions—deadlocks and solutions

The pipeline on a processor is at its core distributing processes. Create a Gantt chart that shows how a modern Intel processor would pipeline incoming instructions and compare it to an AMD processor. RISC-based processors have become important because mobile devices based on the ARM architecture are RISC systems. Use a Gantt chart to map the same set of instructions from the previous chart on the latest ARM system. Then, create a comparison chart of the two competing architectures and try to identify scholarly research that details which architecture best fits a distributed system; and then present a summary.

Write a paper where you will reflect on clock synchronization models processor concurrency and its importance for distributed systems. Include all diagrams and Gantt chart along with the explanations supporting each illustration, including references.

Your paper should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course by providing new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect scholarly writing and current APA standards.

Length: 10-20 slides not including the title and reference slides. Present the results of your analysis and recommendations, with screenshots of the diagrams designed along with its explanations and interpretations. You will also submit the network mapping diagrams (2) created as part of the analysis.
