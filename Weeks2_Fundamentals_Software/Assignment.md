## Part I

Using the diagram designed during Week 1, expand the conceptual distributed systems model, to include software considerations for effective operations and service management using the network. The diagram and narrative should cover the following criteria for configuration:

The system must support multiple, autonomous agents for shared resources while accessing the shared states to perform real-time updates.
The state of the system should be distributed across multiple client or server nodes.
There should only be one centralized service that supports users. It should support logging on, adding clients or servers, deleting clients or servers, and any other tasks to keep the system organized.
The system should be robust and include provisions to manage fault-tolerance or communication gaps.
In the case of a node crashing the system, how could the remaining network connections continue to operate?
After a node crashes, how can it recover to its normal state and resume operations (tolerance levels)?

## Part II

You could consider CORBA and Jini as competing options for creating distributed systems. However, while CORBA has taken off, Jini has been slow to be adopted and has actually been turned over to the Apache Foundation and is called River. For this task, implement a Hello World program in each technology, and then reflect on the current state of market share for each technology. In your research, identify any threats to CORBAâ€™s dominance of the market. You should submit screenshots of the working Hello World programs, code, and an explanation of how each was constructed. Finally, include a reflection on the two technologies and if you could identify any future technology that may replace CORBA.

Length: 4-9 pages, not including title page and references. The document must include a screenshot of the updated or expanded diagram, plus the diagram file must also be submitted. Must also include an explanation of the programs, screenshots of the programs with the explanation and reflection on the exercise.

Your paper should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course by providing new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect scholarly writing and current APA standards.
