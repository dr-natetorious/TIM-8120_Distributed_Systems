# Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

## Understanding the Dynamics of Service-Oriented Architecture Implementation (2015)

The authors [Xitong, L; Stuart, M](Dynamics_SOA_Implementation.pdf) interviewed multiple IT professionals and through a semistructured questionare attempted to answer _why embracing SOA work for some compoanys and not others_?

One of their key reasons was the `worst-before-better` phenomena, that caused many companies to abandon hope prematurely. For many interviewees the path to success was understanding that transforming to SOA would require `duration of committment` more than anything.

The authors explored this notion and found that often insufficient learnings would take place. These challenges led to frustration and the developers blamed the technology, instead of their training. Several identicial examples appeared with both the `PRO SOA` and `ANTI SOA` audiences, such as complexity to configure system. The more trained staff discovered patterns to centralize and decentralize these configurations, with high fluidity and best fit for the scenario capabilities. However, the non-trained staff found the different options available confusing and wanted a one-size fits all.

## A Hybrid Architecture Framework for Simulations in a Service-Oriented Environment (2017)

The authors [Erskine, H; Karsten, B; Martin, M](HybridFramework_Simulation_SOA.pdf) explore _Modeling and Simulation_ implementations in the context of Service Oriented Architecture. Their example centers around a system designed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for wartime planning.

NATO used a collection of _loosely coupled system_ to model each component within their [WarGames](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/) system. As each component within the system interacts across a service contract, it became possible to have multiple implementations of each service; specifically `Live, Virtual, and Construction`.

These multiple implementations allowed for the simulation of virtually any scenario with a blend between both the physical and logical worlds.

Attention to categorization and definitions was given particular focus large parts of the paper.

## Multimedia Teaching Platform Construction for Fashion Design Based on Simulation and Synchronous Teaching System (2018)

The authors [Qu, P](MultiMedia_Platform_Based_on_Simulation.pdf) describes the role of SOA within the context of a _Fashion Design college course series_. Online educational platforms have a need to provide multi-media files to the students, however traditional monolithic systems are clunky to enhance.

Instead a case study is evaluated where SOA enabled the teachers to gain _capability agility_. An example includes new content publishing strategies that could be added and then updated inline without introducing additional risk to the previous system performance.

> Different from object orientation, SOA takes service as the basic unit of system construction. Each independent logic unit is integrated through deploying SOA. SOA can reduce the difference between the platform and programming language so as to achieve cross-platform development.

### What Implementation Patterns Exist

*Service agent implementation pattern*: in such pattern, the requester does not need to know the details of service provider about the service but gains the service through agent mode. Both parties do not establish the direct connection, as shown in Fig 1.

*Packaging service implementation pattern*: the pattern can gain SOA system through packing the existing functions into services and solves the integration problem between SOA system and the original system. Packaging can fully embody the advantages of SOA in cross-platform and cross-system, as shown in Fig.2.

*Virtual service implementation pattern*: such pattern combines the above two patterns. The main function is to offer the functions that existing services cannot implement. In other words, the function of existing system is converted to services first through the packaging service pattern, and then the conversion I conducted with the help of a service agent. Finally, Fa√ßade [10] mode is used to unify the difference between two services as shown in Fig.3.

*Service integration implementation pattern*: such mode can fully embody the advantage of SOA in recombination. The brand-new service is gained through recombination of workflow and combining different function demands. Such pattern contributes to improving system efficiency, reducing the pressure of service terminal and gaining the better exhibition effect, as shown in Fig.4.

*Event Service Broker (ESB) pattern*: as a common pattern, ESB-based SOA design pattern can solve service interaction and communication problem. Besides, it supports controllable distributed bottom framework and owns information sharing ability. The interaction methods of ESB mode include synchronous processing and asynchronous processing, as shown in Fig.5.
