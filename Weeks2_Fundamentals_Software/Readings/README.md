## A Hybrid Architecture Framework for Simulations in a Service-Oriented Environment (2017)

The authors [Erskine, H; Karsten, B; Martin, M](HybridFramework_Simulation_SOA.pdf) explore _Modeling and Simulation_ implementations in the context of Service Oriented Architecture. Their example centers around a system designed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for wartime planning.

NATO used a collection of _loosely coupled system_ to model each component within their [WarGames](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/) system. As each component within the system interacts across a service contract, it became possible to have multiple implementations of each service; specifically `Live, Virtual, and Construction`.

These multiple implementations allowed for the simulation of virtually any scenario with a blend between both the physical and logical worlds.

Attention to categorization and definitions was given particular focus large parts of the paper.

## Understanding the Dynamics of Service-Oriented Architecture Implementation (2015)

The authors [Xitong, L; Stuart, M](Dynamics_SOA_Implementation.pdf) interviewed multiple IT professionals and through a semistructured questionare attempted to answer _why embracing SOA work for some compoanys and not others_?

One of their key reasons was the `worst-before-better` phenomena, that caused many companies to abandon hope prematurely. For many interviewees the path to success was understanding that transforming to SOA would require `duration of committment` more than anything.

The authors explored this notion and found that often insufficient learnings would take place. These challenges led to frustration and the developers blamed the technology, instead of their training. Several identicial examples appeared with both the `PRO SOA` and `ANTI SOA` audiences, such as complexity to configure system. The more trained staff discovered patterns to centralize and decentralize these configurations, with high fluidity and best fit for the scenario capabilities. However, the non-trained staff found the different options available confusing and wanted a one-size fits all.
