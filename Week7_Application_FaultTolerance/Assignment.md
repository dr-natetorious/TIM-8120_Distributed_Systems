# Week 7 - Assignment: Design a Tree Structure for File and Data Allocation and Implement a Fault Tolerance Technique

Consider a scenario in which you have servers running different processes and applications that handle and share thousands of files. Among the processes or applications are:

- Domain Name Server (DNS)
- Proxy Server
- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution
- Corporate Project Management System (in-house developed application communicating with the ERP)
- Distributed File and Database Servers (Oracle, Informix, DB2, Sybase, and SQL Server)

Assess the risk factors associated with processing and execution failure to define and implement a fault tolerance strategy for network support. Write a paper presenting the results of your analysis and recommendations for fault tolerance and risk mitigation techniques for network performance reliability.

Explore data structures for file server organization (trees, stacks, queues, linked lists, etc.) and construct a table detailing the characteristics of each. Include illustrations of each, making sure all references and citations are formatted according to APA format. Design a tree-structure for file allocation from at least three applications running on the distributed system model used in the Week 1 and Week 2 assignments.

Research and discuss the most important algorithms for solving shortest path problems and how they benefit distributed systems. Draw diagrams to support your postures with the corresponding explanations:

- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Bellman–Ford algorithm
- A* search algorithm
- Floyd–Warshall algorithm
- Johnson's algorithm
- Viterbi algorithm

You will submit a paper of 7-10 pages (not including cover page and references) presenting the results of your analysis and recommendations, with screenshots of the diagrams designed along with its explanations and interpretations. You will also submit the tree mapping diagrams (2) created as part of the analysis.

Your paper should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course by providing new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect scholarly writing and current APA standards.
