# Assignment

Create a table in which you compare the main features of the main protocols being used in networks these days for varied platforms (Windows-based, Unix and Linux-based, Apple-based, and mainframe nodes), list their main features, purpose, and corresponding level in the OSI model.

Then research network management suites available in the market with capability for resource sharing and multiprocessing management.
    - Create a table listing the main features, advantages, and disadvantages of each.
    - Include in the table the main reasons why most operating systems have not been successful in supporting distributed systems.
    - Make sure you include major protocols representing client/server architecture, mainframe processing (systems network architecture [SNA] and its mapping to the OSI model), and Apple-based network protocols.

Research and present a table of:
    - popular programming languages for systems programming and their features
    - along with a diagram illustrating how the system shares the information on the hard drive.
    - Include the sources.

Using the distributed system landscape scenario used in Weeks 1 and 2, assume the network includes an
    - ERP server with two instances or segments of the same systems for load balancing,
    - a database server
    - an email server
    - file-sharing system

Expand the distributed network diagram to now include
    - at least three protocols to handle communication between different platforms
    - varying from each OSI model layer (physical connections, data link and transmission, session, presentation layers, and so on),
        - from the table analyzed as the first part of this assignment, and its function in each.
    - Insert the suggested protocols for each server and explain why in the paper narrative.

Capture a screenshot of the diagram and insert it in the document as part of your narrative, analysis, interpretations, and explanations. Make sure you submit both the document and the diagram file

Length: 4-7 pages, not including title page and references. The document must include a screenshot of the updated or expanded diagram, plus the diagram file must also be submitted.
