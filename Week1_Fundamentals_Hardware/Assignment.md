# Create a Conceptual Diagram of a Basic Distributed System

## Instructions

Consider a scenario for a retailer enterprise with different plants and stores distributed across many U.S. states and launching a globalization strategy. This strategic plan includes increasing online presence and expanding their distribution channels. The retailer chain manufactures and distributes three clothing lines that are also marketed in other major retailer chains and online. The company has its headquarters in South Carolina; a major manufacturing plant in Seattle, Washington; another in Maine; plus 30 stores nationwide. They’ll soon be opening three international stores—one each in Spain, England, and New Zealand. They have approximately 3,000 employees. Their computing infrastructure is approximately 500 computers, 200 point-of-sale terminals connected to servers distributed at the headquarters in South Carolina, Seattle, and Maine. There are an estimated 300 printers also distributed and shared across the network.

### Part I

Using diagraming software such as Visio or other diagramming software, create a distributed system model diagram for the proposed corporate scenario. Everyone in the headquarters should have access to the clothing-line catalog, shared files, and resources. Printers, scanners, routers, and switches need to be included, plus the corporate webpage and the corporate intranet for sales, shipping, and processing and internal administrative tasks. Once completed, copy and paste the image to a Word document, and write a paper detailing the advantages and disadvantages of your solution for distributed computing for the company. Submit the original diagram file plus the summary document with your analysis and interpretation of the solution.

### Part II

Vertex, or graph coloring, is often used in scheduling computation tasks on a processor. On modern computer processors, there are multiple cores, and on Intel chips something called “Hyperthreading” that makes each core effectively act like two cores. For this task, you will research how the scheduling is done on a modern Intel Quad Core processor. You will draw a Gantt chart representing 10 processes of varying length executing on the processor, and describe how the scheduling is accomplished, listing the average start time and completion time on the processor.

Length: Network diagram, Gantt chart, and a 5- to 7-page paper where you will present a summary stating the benefits, limitations, and challenges of a distributed system, plus your interpretation.

Your paper should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course by providing new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect scholarly writing and current APA standards.
