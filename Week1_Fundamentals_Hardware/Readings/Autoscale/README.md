## Software rejuvenation in cluster computing systems with dependency between nodes (2013)

The authors [Menghui Yang, Geyong Min, Weikang Yang, and Zituo Li](Software_Rejuvenation_in_clusters_with_dependencies.pdf) describe challenges within _software aging_, which is increased error state that follows after software systems have been running for a long period of time. It is caused by all of the baggage, such as leaked handles and minor memory corruption. Eventually the system will crash and the outage will impact the customer.

To mitigate these
