# TIM-8120_Distributed_Systems

Notes, papers and projects regarding the emerging issues in massively parallel processing.

Distributed computing is becoming more commonplace as cloud and mobile technologies, super-speed wired and wireless connection interactions continue to evolve. In this course you will focus on strategies to coordinate information technology efforts over vast distances. You will study the emerging trends, tools and technologies that allow systems working from different geographic locations, platforms or configurations to integrate and work as a single system. You will apply these strategies and techniques to effectively manage a distributed computing platform.

## Learning Objectives

1. Adapt traditional computer science theories to distributed and massively parallel processing environments.

2. Evaluate  emerging techniques in distributed computing for their efficiency and usefulness in a given situation.

3. Design solutions to computing problems using distributed techniques. Evaluate the impact of emerging technologies on distributed computing.

4. Design solutions to computer problems using distributed systems.
